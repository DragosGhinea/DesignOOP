# Design patterns visualizer and documentation web platform - DesignOOP

## Motivation

I have a strong interest in object-oriented programming and design patterns, which simplify complex software. Teaching is a powerful method to deepen understanding, so I've been eager to create educational resources on design patterns. Leveraging my college studies, I aim to build a practical, functional full-stack application using various technologies.

## Purpose

The application provides a platform for learning and creating courses on design patterns. Initially, it was a repository of hardcoded courses, but now courses are dynamically generated from JSON data for easier editing and management. 

Custom tools were developed to enhance user experience, including an integrated editor with custom linting and a graphics creator. The platform offers official courses and tools for creating new ones, catering to both experienced developers and beginners. By separating content from design, the web platform ensures a consistent look and feel across all courses, allowing creators to focus on content.

## Features

- **Dynamic Course Generation:** Courses generated from JSON data.
- **Integrated Editor:** Custom editor with linting.
- **Graphics Creator:** Tool for visual aids.
- **Learning and Teaching Tools:** Resources for creating and learning design patterns.
- **Consistent Design:** Web platform manages design for uniformity.
